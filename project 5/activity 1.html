                <h2>The World Of Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    Gaming has evolved far beyond its pixelated beginnings. Once limited to arcades and bulky consoles, it has now become a
                    global phenomenon—an art form, a competitive sport, a social experience, and a personal escape. From vast open-world
                    adventures that let players explore ancient lands or distant galaxies, to fast-paced multiplayer matches that test
                    reflexes and teamwork, games offer something for everyone.
                    
                    More than just entertainment, gaming builds communities. Whether through voice chat, online co-op, or shared
                    livestreams, players connect with others across the world, forming friendships and rivalries that often last beyond the
                    screen. For many, games also provide a way to cope with stress, express creativity, or explore stories in an interactive
                    way that no other medium can match.
                    
                    As technology continues to push boundaries—through VR, AI, and cloud gaming—the future of gaming promises even more
                    immersive and inclusive experiences. In a world where reality can be challenging, gaming offers a space to dream,
                    explore, and be whoever you want to be.

                    Over 3 billion people play video games globally as of 2025—that’s nearly 40% of the world’s population.
                    
                    The global video game industry is worth over $250 billion, making it larger than the movie and music industries
                    combined.
                    
                    The average gamer is around 34 years old, and nearly half of all gamers are women.
                    
                    The first video game ever created was "Tennis for Two" in 1958, followed by the more famous "Pong" in 1972.
                    
                    Tetris is one of the best-selling games of all time, with over 520 million copies sold across all platforms.
                    
                    Studies show that gaming can improve hand-eye coordination, problem-solving skills, and reaction times
